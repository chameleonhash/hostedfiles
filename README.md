# <center> GitHub: Free Cloud Storage & File Hosting </center> 

### Free alternative, useful for smaller operation file hosting, cloud storage, and hyperlinking.
### Any file extension is supported, i.e. png, jpg, mp4, gif, exe, mp3, pdf (see size limits below).
### Easy to link, share and access for downloading or viewing any time.

 
## *Known Limitations as of 2023:* 

* If you attempt to add a file that is larger than 50 MB, you will receive a warning from Git. 
* If you add a file to repo via a browser, the file can be no larger than 25 MB. 
* When uploading files to a repository via the command line, GitHub allows single uploads as large as 100 MB.
* For more information, see ["Adding a File to a Repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository).

### To link or embed a file from your hosted repository in an HTML document, or to download, simply append 
### `?raw=true` to the file's URL, which provides the downloadable/embeddable version of the file's address.

### If the web address to your file is 

-- *https://github.com/chameleonhash/hostedfiles/blob/main/assets/pics/gifs/Trippy-Cat.gif*

-- *simply add `?raw=true` to the end of that URL like so:* 

-- *https://github.com/chameleonhash/hostedfiles/blob/main/assets/pics/gifs/Trippy-Cat.gif?raw=true*

--*With the new URL, you can now directly link the file, embed it on another webpage, or even directly download it by simply pasting the appended URL into any browser address bar*


### For example, below this line, a "Trippy Cat" gif, which is stored in this repository, should be embedded.  Through the appropriate HTML markdown syntax, which includes the designated URL of the file, and also, appending `?raw=true` to that address, we are able to embed the "Trippy Cat" below. As long as there is a "Trippy Cat" gif beneath this line, we have a functioning proof of work example of embedding a file:
